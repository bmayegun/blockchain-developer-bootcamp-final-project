## General Project Idea

MileStones lets you create an agreement broken into milestones which when met, there is a payout. It is useful in tracking progress of tasks, pay per milestone, and incentivising people to fulfill agreements. 

#### **🔥🥁 Enter MileStones 🔥🥁**

---

MileStones ensures that MileStone-givers can stake their wealth of equivalent stake on the platform per milestone reached or promised fulfilled. This ensures that MileStones-takers don't lose out on completion of a task or when time lapses on a Promise.

MileStone-keepers too are assured of a refund if a milestone isn't reached or when time lapses before a required milestone is reached.

#### **USER TYPES**

---

1. MileStone-GIVER (required): User who creates MileStones on the platform, staking his wealth or token against a promise or milestone

2. MileStone-TAKER (required): User who recieves staked tokens at the end of the MileStones life cycle.

3. MileStone-VERIFIER (optional): Optional third party User that checks and verifies that a required milestone condition has been met.

#### **POSSIBLE USERS OR USE CASES**

---

- Freelancers
- People hiring Freelancers
- Politicians - to prove trust
- Electorates - to measure and enforce accountability
- AoP: Any other Person - to hold eachother accountable on a goal
